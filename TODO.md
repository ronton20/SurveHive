# SurveHive — TODO / Ideas

Backlog of planned features and ideas — a running wishlist to pull from. Items struck
through with a *(done…)* note are already implemented (Phases 0–5A); the rest are still
open. Roughly grouped; order within a group is not priority.
See `README.md` for what already exists, `CHANGELOG.md` for the release history, and
`CLAUDE.md` for coding standards.

> **Active execution plan:** `PLAN.md` is the phased, do-one-thing-at-a-time breakdown of
> everything below, in priority order. Start there. This file remains the backlog/wishlist
> and the rationale; `PLAN.md` is the sequencing. When a phase lands, tick it here too.

## Combat System Overhaul 2.0 — the three power-up lanes (top priority; PLAN Phase 1)

The level-up offer is being restructured from one flat skill pool into **three distinct
lanes**, each with its own selection cap and its own card banner/label so the player reads at
a glance what kind of pick it is. This supersedes the old TODO #18 "Passive / Active / Magic"
category split — the lanes below *are* the categories; **element** (fire / poison / electric /
frost / honey / physical) stays as an orthogonal tag on top for #19 set effects.

- **PASSIVES** — enhancements to the *player itself* (never the attacks). Move speed, max HP,
  **armor (new — flat/% damage-taken reduction)**, attack power, attack speed, **ability
  cooldown**, **ability damage/power (new — scales Abilities)**, crit chance, crit damage,
  lifesteal, pickup magnet. **Cap: 5 distinct passives**; once 5 are owned, no *new* passive
  is offered (owned ones keep leveling). Existing basic-attack-shaping passives (projectile
  count, attack range) migrate *out* of this lane into Enhancements.
- **ENHANCEMENTS (new lane)** — modifiers to the *basic auto-attack*, scaling with attack
  power + level. **Cap: 3 distinct.** Projectile +1 (each projectile hits softer, but ~1.5×
  total damage), lifesteal-on-attack, **ignite (new — attacks apply burn)**, other elemental
  procs, **piercing shot (moved off the active list — attacks deal less damage but pierce)**,
  attack range, and any other basic-attack modifier. Needs a data-driven modifier layer over
  `AutoAttack`/`Projectile`.
- **ABILITIES** — the "active" auto-firing skills, separate from the basic attack, scaling
  with level + ability power. **Cap: 5 distinct.** Honey bomb, chain lightning, the 360°
  stinger burst (**make it pierce too**), exploding stinger, poison cloud, etc. — add more per
  element as elements land. (These are today's `ActiveSkillSO` weapons.)

Every offer card gets a **category banner/label** (Passive / Enhancement / Ability) plus the
element cue from #18. Placeholder status/element icons now live in
`Assets/ThirdParty/FantasyStatusIcons/` (slice + wire until custom art replaces them).

**Power-up readability (follow-on UX — help players strategize around the lane caps):**
- **Lane counter on the offer card** — under each card's lane banner, show a `owned/cap`
  counter (e.g. `1/5` passives, `2/3` enhancements, `4/5` abilities) so the player can see at a
  glance how much room a lane still has before committing a pick. The controller already tracks
  owned-per-lane counts for gating (`LaneEligibility`); surface them on the banner.
- **Owned power-ups list in the pause menu** — a panel listing every power-up the player
  currently owns this run, grouped by lane, each with its current level (and ideally its
  element cue), so mid-run they can review their build. Reads the same per-run level state the
  level-up controller holds; the pause menu already exists (Phase 4C).

## Boss & Wave Drama (PLAN Phase 2)

- **Pre-spawn warnings** — 5 seconds before a strong wave or a boss/miniboss spawns, show a
  warning banner counting in until it arrives (the timeline currently fires spawns instantly).
- **Impactful miniboss kill** — a miniboss death grants a **guaranteed lucky power-up (+2
  levels, still random)** plus a burst of EXP, so it feels like a real reward beat.
- **Boss/miniboss death sequence** — on any boss/miniboss death, drop into **slow-motion** for
  the death animation, make the **player invulnerable** for its duration, add a **shockwave +
  screen shake**, and hold all downstream events (rewards, victory, timeline resume) until the
  animation finishes.

## Suggested implementation order (open items)

A recommended sequence for the *remaining* work, ordered by dependency and payoff. Item
numbers refer to the backlog entries below. Nothing here is binding — it's the path that
unlocks the most with the least rework. **The Combat 2.0 overhaul and Boss/Wave Drama above
now lead this order (PLAN Phases 1–2); the chain below follows as PLAN Phases 3+.**

**A. Combat Depth 2.0 — the biggest richness-per-effort win.** Do these *in order*; each
one is a prerequisite for the next, and doing them out of order means retrofitting:
1. **#18 Enhancement categories & elements** — the taxonomy (category + element enums on
   the skill SOs) + card badges. Foundation for everything below; also improves build
   readability on its own, so it pays off even if you stop here.
2. **#20 Damage typing (physical vs magic)** — every damage application carries a type.
   Small, mechanical, and unlocks defenses paying off.
3. **#23 Enemy defenses beyond HP** (armor / physical shield / magic shield) — makes damage
   typing *matter* and gives raw-damage builds a reason to diversify.
4. **#19 Elemental set effects** (2/3/4+ same-element bonuses) — the reward payoff for
   committing to an element; depends on #18's tagging.

**B. Enemy variety (#22)** — independent of chain A and the cheapest big *feel* win, since
ranged / bomber / swarm all reuse existing pools + components. Slot it in whenever; it
interleaves well with chain A (e.g. a magic-shielded ranged bee once #20/#23 exist).

**C. Final-polish leftovers** (the tail of the original build push — Phases 0–5A are done):
5. ~~**Difficulty / curve tuning pass** — wants chains A/B in place *and* real playtest
   feedback, so it comes after the systems it balances exist. Target: a first-time player
   dies around **minute 8–12**; a meta-invested player can **clear** the Queen.~~ *(done in
   Phase 1A rounds 1–2, 2026-07-09: economy/crit nerfs, then a simulation-verified density +
   curve retune and the Queen anti-stall enrage — see `CHANGELOG.md`; confirm feel next playtest.)*
6. **Mobile UI overhaul (#14–17) + mobile sanity pass** — the gap for "mobile-ready";
   safe-area anchoring is the most urgent (the notch currently hides HUD meters).
7. ~~**Localization seam** — cheap now, only gets more expensive as UI/string count grows;
   worth doing *before* the mobile UI pass touches all that text anyway.~~ *(done as PLAN
   Phase 3A, 2026-07-09: UI chrome flows through `Loc.Get` → a key→string `StringTableSO`;
   SO-authored content stays authoritative. See `CHANGELOG.md`.)*

**D. Content expansion** — additional worlds (Garden / Woods / City / Alien Ship), custom
Aseprite hero/boss art, a real hive tileset/floor. The biggest lift; best once the systems
above are locked so new content drops into a stable framework rather than a moving one.

> Rule of thumb: **A + B deepen the game that exists; C hardens it for release; D grows it.**
> If you only want one more push, do **A** — it's what turns "more numbers" into "more decisions."

---

## Skills & Progression
1. ~~**Skill rarity system** — some skills show up more often than others (weighted by rarity tier, not just the current flat `_weight`).~~ *(done in Phase 2: Common/Rare/Epic tiers drive weighted offers + card frame colors.)*
2. ~~**Skill double-level chance** — small chance a skill level-up grants +2 levels instead of +1; change the skill card background to indicate the lucky roll.~~ *(done in Phase 2: lucky picks with a green card.)*
3. ~~**More skills** — pickup/magnet range, crit chance, lifesteal, projectile pierce, projectile speed, cooldown reduction, etc.~~ *(done in Phase 2: 10 passives incl. magnet, crit chance/damage, lifesteal, CDR; pierce lives on the Piercing Lance active.)*
18. **Power-up categories & elements** — classify every level-up offer into one of the three **lanes** (Passive / Enhancement / Ability — see "Combat System Overhaul 2.0" above) and tag it with an **element** (fire/poison/electric/frost/honey/physical…). Surface both on the choice card: a lane banner/badge and an element-colored frame or gem, so the player reads at a glance what kind of pick it is and what element it feeds. Groundwork for #19 (set effects). Needs a small taxonomy on `SkillDefinitionSO`/`ActiveSkillSO` (lane/category enum + element enum) and card-UI slots for the badges. *(Delivered as PLAN Phase 1A/1B.)*

## Combat Depth
4. ~~**Status effects** — burn, poison, slow, stun, freeze (damage-over-time + stat modifiers with durations).~~ *(done in Phase 2: all five, zero-GC fixed-slot buffers with stacking/freeze-break/stun-DR rules.)*
5. ~~**Elemental abilities** — attacks/skills that apply status effects with a chance (e.g. fire → burn, ice → slow/freeze).~~ *(done in Phase 2: 6 active skills, four of which proc statuses — honey→slow, pollen→poison, static→stun, ember→burn. A frost "Chilling Nectar" freeze applier is designed as skill #7 if the roster needs it.)*
19. ~~**Elemental set effects** — reward committing to an element: owning **2 / 3 / 4+** enhancements of the same element grants escalating set bonuses (e.g. 2× fire → +burn duration, 4× fire → burn also spreads). Depends on the element tagging from #18. Design the thresholds + per-element bonuses as data (a `SetBonusSO` per element with tiered effects), track owned counts per element on the player, and show active set tiers somewhere on the HUD.~~ *(done as PLAN Phase 3C: 6 `SetBonusSO` assets (2/3/4-piece tiers) amplify the element's status potency/duration — physical sharpens the basic attack; `ElementSets` service + HUD tier line.)*
20. ~~**Damage typing (physical vs magic)** — split damage into **physical** and **magic** so defenses (#23) and elements can interact with it. Auto-attack/stingers = physical; magic skills (honey/pollen/ember/static) = magic. Every damage application carries a type; `DamageService` and status DoTs stamp it. Prerequisite for #18 elements paying off defensively and for #23.~~ *(done as PLAN Phase 3A: `DamageType` carried by every `TakeDamage`/`DealDamage`; abilities stamp per-asset type matching their card element, DoTs are magic, contact/enemy projectiles physical.)*

## Waves & Enemies
6. ~~**Escalating spawns** — increase enemy spawn rate/count as the run progresses (distinct from the current per-minute stat scaling).~~ *(done in Phase 3: stage spawn-rate curve 1×→3.5×.)*
7. ~~**Strong / Dangerous waves** — periodic waves with significantly higher enemy counts and possibly special spawn patterns/formations.~~ *(done in Phase 3: surround ring at 25%, directional flood at 75%.)*
8. ~~**Bosses** — mini-bosses and a per-world final boss (e.g. Beehive: Queen's Royal Guard minibosses → Queen Bee).~~ *(done in Phase 3: Royal Guard charge miniboss + 3-pattern Queen Bee; killing her wins the run.)*
22. ~~**More enemy archetypes** — beyond the current chase-and-touch bees, add behavior variety: **ranged** (keeps distance, fires projectiles — reuse the `EnemyProjectile` pool), **suicide bombers** (rush the player and explode in an AoE on contact/death), and **swarms** (large packs of weak, fast, low-HP enemies that pressure by numbers). Each is a new behavior component + `EnemyStatsSO` rank, slotted into the wave/stage spawn tables.~~ *(done as PLAN Phase 4: **Spitter Bee** 4A — magic-shielded, `RangedAttack` kites to a firing band and fires telegraphed pooled stingers, 90s; **Bomber Bee** 4B — `BomberAttack` rushes, fuses, AoE blast on fuse or death, 150s; **Swarmling** 4C — `SwarmMovement` wobble + packSize spawns in the wave table, packs of 6 at 60s.)*
23. ~~**Enemy defenses beyond HP** — give enemies defensive layers so raw damage isn't the only answer (and damage typing #20 matters): **armor** (flat or % reduction to physical damage), **physical shield** (absorbs a pool of physical damage, magic bypasses it), **magic shield** (absorbs magic damage, physical bypasses it), and combinations for elites/bosses. Model as an ordered damage-mitigation pipeline on the enemy (shield → armor → HP) reading the incoming damage type; show shield/armor state via a tint or overlay bar. Depends on #20.~~ *(done as PLAN Phase 3B: `EnemyDefense` pipeline on every enemy via the typed absorber/mitigator seams; QueensGuard magic shield + armor, Royal Guard physical shield + armor, Queen both + armor; health-bar fill tints by active shield type.)*

## Run Structure
9. ~~**Stage progress bar** — a per-stage timeline: Strong Waves at 25% and 75%, mini-boss at 50%, final boss at 100%.~~ *(done in Phase 3: HUD bar with siren/skull/crown markers.)*
10. ~~**Item drops** — potion / honey jar (heal), magnet (pull all pickups), shield, screen-nuke, etc.~~ *(done in Phase 3: Honey Jar / Magnet / Wax Shield / Royal Bomb, drop tables on enemy stats.)*

## Mobile UI Overhaul
*(from Device Simulator testing 2026-07-04 — PC-first for now, tackle alongside the Phase 5 mobile sanity pass)*
> **⚠ Superseded 2026-07-08:** the UI overhaul (#25) now includes a **PC-only pivot — mobile
> support is being abandoned**. Items #14–17 and #24 below stay for reference but should be
> struck rather than built when #25 lands.
14. **Safe area support** — the notch/punch-hole hides HUD meters (health/EXP bars, timer); all HUD anchors must respect `Screen.safeArea`.
15. **UI scale pass for small screens** — HUD bars, counters, damage numbers, and card text are all too small at phone DPI; likely a `CanvasScaler` reference-resolution/match rework plus per-element size bumps.
16. **Skill cards relayout for portrait/mobile** — cards should be oriented horizontally (icon left, name/description right) and stacked vertically instead of the current three tall side-by-side columns.
17. **General mobile layout audit** — boss bar/banner, stage progress markers, results screens, and shield/aura indicators checked on tall aspect ratios (19.5:9+) in both orientations.
24. **Mobile sanity pass** — verify joystick + tap flows in the Device Simulator on an **iPhone + a tall Android** profile, confirm HUD respects safe areas, texture memory is sane, and run a profiling pass at target-ish resolution (zero-GC + frame-rate regression check after all additions). *(Companion to #14–17: those fix layout, this verifies it on-device.)*

## Meta & Content
11. ~~**Menus** — main menu, level/world selection, difficulty selection.~~ *(done in Phase 4B: MainMenu boot scene with home/world select/shop/settings-shell panels; Garden+Woods shown locked; difficulty dropdown seam fixed to Normal until a difficulty system exists.)*
12. ~~**Meta progression** — the persistent between-run currency spend + upgrade system and its UI (the `IMetaProgressionStore` seam already exists for this).~~ *(done in Phases 4A+4B: JSON save, six escalating-cost stat upgrades applied at run start, purchase transactions, and the Hive Upgrades shop UI.)*
13. **Art & polish** — ~~real sprites, animations, VFX, and proper UI elements to replace placeholders~~ *(done in Phase 1: PixelFantasy bee rig + animations, death VFX, pixel UI kit + BoldPixels TMP. Hive honeycomb floor landed as a procedural placeholder in Phase 6B — the arena now reads as a place, not a void; final art can overwrite `Assets/Sprites/Tiles/HiveFloor.png`. Remaining: custom Aseprite/AI hero + boss art (Phase 6A).)*

---

## Release & polish wishlist *(added 2026-07-07 after the Phase 3 playtest)*
25. **Complete UI overhaul** — fit to PC, enlarge text, smoother animations, click sounds, health bars, etc. *(Progress: 3B-1 meta-shop tabs + 3B-2a landscape-PC layout/text fit done 2026-07-09 — both canvases retargeted to a 1920×1080 landscape reference, un-shrinking all UI text on desktop. 3B-2b click/hover sounds done 2026-07-10 — click coverage was already blanket, added a throttled hover tick via `IPointerEnterHandler` on the shared `UIClickSfx`. 3B-2c UI motion done 2026-07-10 — shared zero-GC easing/fade layer (`Core/Easing.cs` + `UI/UiAnim.cs`, unscaled time), level-up cards deal in with a staggered scale/slide pop, and pause + main-menu panels fade on switch. Playtest follow-up 2026-07-10 — the 3B-2a canvas retarget hadn't repositioned anything, so the meta shop fell off-screen and menus stayed mobile-narrow: reworked to a landscape 3-column shop + widened World/Settings into PC "windows"; the home screen is title-top-left with a bottom-left vertical button stack (75% size) on a transparent panel for future background art (`MetaShopTabsBuilder` rework + new `PcMenuLayoutBuilder`). Fixed silent menu buttons across both scenes and the world-select difficulty dropdown (`UISoundCoverageBuilder` + new `UISelectableSfx` — 12+14 buttons and 1 dropdown were missing click/hover SFX). Health-bar readability (3B-2d) done 2026-07-10 — player bar health-graded green→red + numeric readout + critical pulse + lagging damage trail, boss bar trail + low-HP red shift, enemy bars bigger/framed for contrast (`HealthBarPolishBuilder` + `HealthColorGradient` + shared zero-GC `UIBarTrail`). **3B (UI overhaul) complete.**)* *(Scope additions 2026-07-08:)*
    - **PC-only pivot — abandoning mobile support.** Remove mobile support entirely; fit UI and controls for PC only. *(Supersedes the whole "Mobile UI Overhaul" section — #14–17, #24 — and PLAN.md Phase 4 "Mobile readiness"; strike those when this lands.)*
    - ~~**Meta shop UI rework** — category **tabs on the left**: **Combat / Survival / Utility** (settled 2026-07-08; maps the current 13 upgrades as Combat = Damage, Attack Speed, Crit Chance, Crit Damage, Ability DMG, Cooldown Cut · Survival = Max HP, Move Speed, Pickup Range · Utility = Honey Gain, EXP Gain, Item Drop Rate, Rerolls); the rest of the screen: **top half** shows the selected upgrade's info (icon, name, description, current rank / max rank, upgrade cost, current stat value, etc.), **bottom half** is a grid of just the upgrade icons for the current category with `[current level]/[max level]` under each icon.~~ *(done in Phase 3B-1, 2026-07-09: exactly this layout — tabs → category icon grid → detail pane → BUY; categories derived from stat type, placeholder icons wired via `MetaShopTabsBuilder`.)*
    - **Owned power-ups menu rework** — separate **power-ups** and **set effects** clearly; each entry shows only its name and `[current level]/[max level]`, with the description + concrete values appearing on mouse hover — the same treatment for both power-ups and set effects.
26. ~~**Status effect visual modifiers** — tint enemies in color based on their active status effect. *(A basic priority tint exists in `StatusEffectReceiver`; this wants a proper, readable pass.)*~~ *(done in Phase 2A, 2026-07-09: per-status tints with priority + stacked-status pulse + hue-kept hit flashes, moved to a shader `_Tint`/MPB path because the rig's animation clips were clobbering `renderer.color` — which also un-broke elite rank tints.)*
27. ~~**Enhance status-effect set bonuses** — richer per-element set effects beyond the current potency/duration scaling (e.g. spread-on-death burns, shatter on frozen kills).~~ *(done in Phase 2B, 2026-07-09: a top-tier signature per element — Wildfire spreads Burn on death, Deep Chill shatters chilled kills for AoE, Overcharge arcs Stun, Virulence pools, Sticky Sweet leaves slow zones, and Sharp Stingers executes sub-15%-HP enemies on the basic attack. `ElementalSetSignatures` death dispatcher + `HealthComponent.Kill`; surfaced as a ✦ line on the offer panel.)*
28. ~~**Enhance meta shop** — way more modifiers to buy: EXP gain, ability power, cooldown reduction, crit rate (+2%/rank, capped 40%), crit damage, **power-up rerolls** (max 3 per run; each reroll replaces 1 offered card, not all 3; steeply escalating cost — the feature is strong, gate it), item drop rate, and any other bonuses that fit.~~ *(done in Phase 1C, 2026-07-08: all seven shipped — 13-upgrade scrollable shop, per-card in-run rerolls at 400/3.8× growth; cross-shop cost rebalance deferred to the 1A round-2 playtest pass.)*
29. ~~**Asset generation list (ElevenLabs)** — a document listing every asset that needs generating, including sizes, pixel density, colors, usage context — ideally an accurate generation prompt per asset.~~ *(done: `ASSET_GENERATION.md` — surveyed every placeholder/missing asset across visuals and audio, with per-item spec + generation prompt; kept living per the `CLAUDE.md` doc policy.)*
30. ~~**Working stage difficulty** — easy / normal / hard / extreme: scales enemy HP and damage but increases honey gain; with per-difficulty icons (ties into #29).~~ *(done in Phase 1B of the current plan, 2026-07-08: data-driven `DifficultySO` tier table, live world-select dropdown with placeholder icons, save-persisted selection; final icons still tracked in `ASSET_GENERATION.md` §2.7.)*
31. ~~**Premium currency — "Royal Jelly"** — earnable in very small amounts through gameplay; spent on cosmetics/revives. Named/iconed in `ASSET_GENERATION.md` §2.8 (a royal comb cell of jelly, distinct from the common Honey drop).~~ *(earning/banking done in Phase 5B, 2026-07-11: +1/miniboss, +3/Queen, one-time 10–25 first-clear bonus per stage+difficulty; a separate never-multiplied pool, save v6, shop-header balance + results line. The spend seam (`TrySpendJelly`) is in the store, waiting on its sinks — cosmetics #32, achievements #33, rotating shop #34; icon still tracked in §2.8.)*
32. ~~**Character customization** — colors (5 basic), hats, stinger skins, etc.~~ *(done in Phase 5C, 2026-07-11: main-menu **Hive Style** panel (STYLE button, shop's tabbed mold) selling 5 body tints + 3 hats + 3 stinger skins for Royal Jelly — buy auto-equips, per-tab DEFAULT cells, equipped badges, live hero preview; `CosmeticApplier` dresses the run hero at spawn (shader-tint body color + Body-rig overlay renderers, skin-agnostic for the 6A art swap); owned/equipped persist in save v7. Placeholder pixel sprites — final art tracked in `ASSET_GENERATION.md` §2.10.)*
33. ~~**Achievements system** — including Steam achievements; unlocks cosmetics and rewards premium currency.~~ *(local-first pass done in Phase 5D, 2026-07-12: 11 achievements over existing signals (kills/level/survival/set tiers/difficulty clears) paying 1–15 jelly each, the Extreme clear granting the Honey Crown; in-run unlock toast + main-menu AWARDS panel; save v8. **Steam upload itself is still open** — the `IAchievementBackend` seam is in place with a no-op local default, so the Steamworks backend lands whenever a Steam build exists.)*
34. ~~**Rotating cosmetics shop** — daily rotating cosmetics for purchase.~~ *(done in Phase 5E, 2026-07-12: main-menu **DEALS** panel — up to 3 not-yet-owned 5C cosmetics per local day at **30% off** (the full catalog stays buyable at list price in Hive Style), picked deterministically from the date (no server) and frozen into save v9 so buying one never re-rolls the others; live countdown to the local-midnight rollover; buying auto-equips.)*
35. ~~**Codex** — all info on power-ups / set effects / enemies / items / etc. that the player has encountered or picked up.~~ *(done in Phase 5A, 2026-07-10: main-menu CODEX panel in the shop's tabbed mold — Power-Ups / Sets / Enemies / Items tabs, icon grid, read-only detail pane, DISCOVERED counter; undiscovered entries are black silhouettes with "???". A run-scoped `CodexTracker` catches skill picks, set-tier activations, every enemy spawn (one hook in `EnemySpawner.SpawnAt` covers drip/waves/bosses/summons), and item pickups, then flushes once to the save at scene teardown — no mid-combat file IO. Save schema v5 (`codexIds`); catalog/panel/tracker authored by the idempotent `CodexBuilder`.)*
36. ~~**Enhanced options** — toggles for enemy HP bars, damage numbers, and similar feedback layers.~~ *(done in Phase 3C, 2026-07-10: five toggles — enemy HP bars, damage numbers, screen shake, hit-stop, status colors — in both settings panels (two-column relayout via `EnhancedOptionsBuilder`), gated at each system's single entry point through the static `FeedbackSettings` live copy; persisted in save v4 with old saves migrating to all-on, applied live mid-run including already-pooled enemy bars.)*
37. **"Transformable" hero color sprites** — replace the 5C whole-body color tints with real
    sprite transformations once the final hero art (6A) lands: per-region recolors (base /
    stripes / antler tips / wings — the confirmed slots in `ASSET_GENERATION.md` §2.10) via a
    palette/mask approach or swapped sprite variants, not a flat multiply over the whole model.
    (Recorded 2026-07-11 from playtest feedback on 5C — tints accepted as the placeholder.)

## Combat feel & power-up depth 2.1 *(added 2026-07-14 from playtest feedback)*
> **Now sequenced in `PLAN.md`:** #39 → **Phase A1**, #38 → **A2**, #42 → **A3**;
> #40 → **Phase B1**, #41 → **B2**, #43 → **B3**. The open #25 owned-power-ups menu rework and
> #37 transformable hero sprites are folded into **Phase C** (C2 blocked on the postponed 6A art).
38. **Abilities feel weak / unimpressive — make them hit harder and *look* impressive.** The 8
    actives currently read as minor background chip damage rather than build-defining payoffs.
    Suggested improvements (mix of numbers + juice, pick per-ability):
    - **Rebalance the damage tables upward** and make Ability Power matter more — abilities
      should visibly clear trash and dent elites, not tickle. Consider scaling their damage with
      player level too (see #39) so a leveled ability stays relevant.
    - **Bigger, punchier VFX + audio**: larger impact bursts, screen-shake/hit-stop on the heavy
      ones (Honey Bomb, Ember Sting, Ball Lightning), a bloom flash on cast, and the missing
      skill SFX (`ASSET_GENERATION.md` §4.1) so they *feel* like they land.
    - **Distinct fantasy per ability**: e.g. Stinger Barrage fires more/faster and knocks back;
      Frost Nova freezes a wide ring; Static Wings chains further and stuns harder; Pollen Cloud
      stacks poison fast. Lean into each element's identity rather than "another projectile."
    - **Scale count/area with level more aggressively** so a high-level ability floods the screen
      (more projectiles, wider zones) — the Vampire-Survivors "screen-filling" power fantasy.
    - Consider a **cast/impact telegraph** and a short slow-mo on the biggest hits.
39. **Status-effect (DoT) damage should scale ONLY with player level + set effects.** Right now
    burn/poison/etc. tick damage is entangled with attack/ability stats. Re-model status DoT
    damage so it is driven purely by **(a) player level** and **(b) active elemental set bonuses**
    — nothing else (attack power, ability power, crit, etc. must not touch it). This makes DoT a
    clean, predictable investment axis. Leave a **hook for future dedicated upgrades** (a "Venom
    Potency"-style passive/meta line) that *can* boost status damage, but those don't exist yet —
    only level + sets feed it for now. Touches `StatusEffect`/`StatusEffectReceiver` tick math and
    the stinger/ability appliers; add EditMode coverage pinning the formula.
40. **More power-ups across all three lanes** — add Passives, Enhancements, and Abilities to widen
    build variety (the lanes have room: passives beyond the current 10, enhancements beyond 7,
    more per-element abilities). Author via the `/power-up` skill / idempotent builder passes.
41. **Synergies between power-ups** — pairs/sets of power-ups that combine into something greater
    than the sum (e.g. Multishot + Piercing = a wall of piercing shots; Frost Stinger + a fire
    ability = "shatter burns"; crit + lifesteal = burst self-heal). Design a data-driven synergy
    layer that detects owned combinations and applies a bonus effect, surfaced on the HUD/offer
    cards so players can *aim* for them. Builds on the existing element set-bonus system.
42. **Special effects for max-level abilities** — when an ability hits its final level (Lv. 5),
    unlock a **signature upgrade**: a visual glow-up plus a mechanical twist (e.g. Ember Sting
    max = leaves a lingering fire pool; Ball Lightning max = orbs split on expiry; Honey Bomb max
    = double blast). Mirrors the elemental set-signature pattern (`ElementalSetSignatures`) but
    per-ability, and gives leveling an ability all the way a real payoff.
43. **Combo skills for certain ability combinations** — owning specific ability *combinations*
    grants a new emergent "combo" effect or even a fused ability (e.g. Honey Splash + Static
    Wings = electrified honey that stuns slowed enemies; Frost Nova + Ember Sting = thermal-shock
    AoE). Related to #41 (synergies) but higher-tier — a distinct combined behavior rather than a
    stat bonus. Needs a combo registry keyed on owned ability sets + its own VFX/telegraph.

## Suggestions / additions to consider
- ~~**Pause & settings menu** — in-run pause (audio/vibration/quality toggles); useful early for testing and expected on mobile.~~ *(done in Phase 4C: ESC/HUD-button pause with resume/settings/abandon; settings shared with the main menu, applied live and saved.)*
- ~~**Run stats / results screen** — on death or stage clear, show time survived, kills, level, currency earned (feeds naturally into meta progression).~~ *(done in Phase 3: results block on both death and victory screens; currency banks on both paths.)*
- ~~**Save/load** — persist meta-progression and settings (goes hand-in-hand with #12; decide on a serialization approach, e.g. JSON in `Application.persistentDataPath`).~~ *(done in Phase 4A: versioned JSON at `persistentDataPath`, safe-write, corrupt→fresh-start.)*
- ~~**Object-pool coverage for new spawners** — keep bosses / strong-wave hordes / drops pooled to hold the zero-GC guarantee as counts grow.~~ *(done across Phases 2–3: 24 pool IDs cover both bosses, enemy projectiles, all four item drops, and every skill projectile/zone/VFX — all spawned via `PoolManager`.)*
- ~~**Difficulty curve tuning pass** — once waves, bosses, and meta upgrades exist, do a dedicated balance pass on exp curve, enemy scaling, spawn curve, drop rates, and boss HP. Target: a first-time player dies around **minute 8–12**; a meta-invested player can clear. Document what changed and why.~~ *(done in Phase 1A rounds 1–2, 2026-07-09: tuned via the new `BalanceRunTest` sim harness; both targets machine-verified, changes logged in `CHANGELOG.md`.)*
- ~~**Audio pass** — SFX for hits/level-up/death/pickups and background music per world.~~ *(done in Phase 5A: pooled `AudioService` + CC0 SFX/music for every listed event, credits in `Assets/Audio/CREDITS.md`.)*
- ~~**Damage feedback** — hit flash / knockback / screen shake to make combat feel impactful (cheap wins alongside status effects).~~ *(done in Phase 1: hit flash, knockback, screen shake, hit-stop on elite kills, death VFX.)*
- ~~**Localization seam** — if wider release is a goal, isolate user-facing strings early rather than retrofitting later: all user-facing strings flow through one string table/asset instead of hardcoded literals (actual translation deferred).~~ *(done in PLAN Phase 3A, 2026-07-09: `Core/Loc` resolver + `LocKeys`/`LocDefaults` + `StringTableSO` Resources asset; UI chrome swept, SO content stays authoritative, translation still deferred.)*
- ~~**Bloom / "magic honey" glow pass** — the URP Bloom post-process is set up (Global Volume) but not yet dialled in; tune a high threshold so only deliberately-bright VFX pixels bloom without smearing the pixel art. Optional follow-on: 2D lights for hive-interior mood.~~ *(done in PLAN Phase 6C, 2026-07-12: high-threshold Bloom dialled in, camera post-processing enabled, honey/magic VFX pushed to HDR via the idempotent `BloomGlowBuilder`. 2D hive-interior lights left as an optional follow-on.)*
